            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm a passionate builder specializing in product strategy & management. I bring a design-oriented and data-driven lens to create beautiful, joyful, and net-positive user experiences.</p>
            <p>With 7 years of experience in tech consulting for Fortune 500 companies, I have developed an extensive understanding of tech, product, and operations - having successfully developed features for world-class e-commerce sites to drive user satisfaction, optimized mission-critical business processes to improve efficiency, and deployed digital marketing campaigns to drive ROI. My consulting background gives me a pulse on the business while driving product development to create the best user experience.</p>
            <p>Right now, I'm interested in creating a company and/or supporting start-ups in bringing their product visions to life. Want to collaborate on an idea or have an opportunity for me? Let's chat!</p>
